  <h1> Google Maps Scraper üó∫Ô∏è </h1>

 Our goal is to scrape all the Google Maps reviews from the stores of the WMF group. <br>
 To do so we decided to fork the "Google Maps Scraper" project. We chose it because it is quite fast, lightweight and completely automated. If you want to check out the original project go [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper). <br>
Also, for more info on the forked project check out the original [README](README_original.md) file.
